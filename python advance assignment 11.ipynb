    "### Q1. What is the concept of a metaclass?\n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "1. Metaclass in Python is a class that defines how a class behaves. It is itself a instance of Metaclass, and any Instance of Class in Python is an Instance of type metaclass. E.g. Type of of `int`, `str`, `float`, `list`, `tuple` and many more is of metaclass type. \n",
    "2. By defining a metaclass, you can add or modify class-level attributes, methods, and behavior.\n",
    "3. Metaclasses are specified by assigning a metaclass to the __metaclass__ attribute or by using the metaclass parameter in the class definition. \n",
    "4. Metaclasses are a powerful feature but are considered advanced and are generally used in specific cases where customization and control over class creation and behavior are required."

    "### Q2. What is the best way to declare a class's metaclass?\n",
    "**Ans:** A way to declare a classâ€™ metaclass is by using **`metaclass`** keyword in class definition.\n",
    "Assign the desired metaclass to the metaclass parameter, specifying the metaclass itself as the value.\n",
    "Ensure that the metaclass is a valid metaclass, which means it should be a subclass of type or a metaclass derived from type.\n",
    "By specifying the metaclass directly in the class definition, you make it clear and explicit which metaclass is associated with the class, enhancing code readability and maintainability.\n",
    "This approach is recommended as it follows the standard and widely understood syntax for defining a class's metaclass.\n",

    "**EXAMPLE:** class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):\n",

    "### Q3. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling classes ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Anything you can do with a class decorator, you can of course do with a custom metaclasses (just apply the functionality of the \"decorator function\", i.e., the one that takes a class object and modifies it, in the course of the metaclass's **`__new__`** or **`__init__`** that make the class object).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### class decorators:\n",
    "Class decorators operate on the class object itself and can be used to enhance its functionality.\n",

    "#### metaclasses:\n",
    "Metaclasses operate at a lower level than class decorators, allowing more fine-grained control over class creation and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overlap:\n",
    "1. Both class decorators and metaclasses can modify or enhance the behavior of classes.\n",
    "2. They can add, modify, or remove attributes, methods, or behavior at the class level.\n",
    "3. Both mechanisms provide ways to customize and extend the functionality of classes in Python."
