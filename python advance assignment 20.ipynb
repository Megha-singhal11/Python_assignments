    "### Q1. Compare and contrast the float and Decimal classes' benefits and drawbacks ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Both the `float` and `decimal` types store numerical values in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Float:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "1. Floats have a wider range and can represent very large or very small numbers.\n",
    "2. Floats are commonly used for general-purpose numerical computations and scientific calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drawbacks:**\n",
    "1. Comparisons between floats require careful handling due to potential precision issues.\n",
    "2. Floats may exhibit unexpected behavior when dealing with values like infinity, NaN (not a number), or denormalized numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decimal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "1. They are suitable for financial and monetary calculations that require precise decimal arithmetic.\n",
    "2. Decimals provide methods for rounding, flooring, and other decimal-specific operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drawbacks:**\n",
    "1. They consume more memory than floats, as they store each digit explicitly.\n",
    "2. Some libraries or external systems may not support Decimal objects directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "the float class is suitable for general-purpose numerical calculations and offers a wider range of values, but it may introduce rounding errors and limited precision. The Decimal class provides exact decimal arithmetic with arbitrary precision, making it suitable for financial calculations, but it may be slower and consume more memory. The choice between float and Decimal depends on the specific requirements of the application, considering factors such as precision, range, accuracy, and performance."

    "### 2. Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') are two objects to consider. In what sense are these the same object? Are these just two ways of representing the exact same value, or do they correspond to different internal states ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Both values are same but internal representation at storage Is different. Precsion  differs, `Decimal('1.200')` gives internally  `1.200` and  `Decimal('1.2')` gives `1.2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') both represent the decimal number 1.2 with exact precision. They are two different instances of the Decimal class.\n",

    "**Ans:** Both values only differ in precision.   \n",

    "### 4. Why is it preferable to start a Decimal object with a string rather than a floating-point value ?\n",
    "**Ans:** Floating-point value is converted to Decimal format. Decimal can store float value with absolute precision. But when float value is given as Decimal object,it first has to be converted from floating point value which might already have rounding error.\n",
    "starting a Decimal object with a string instead of a floating-point value allows for an exact representation of the decimal value, avoids floating-point approximation errors, provides controlled precision, ensures predictable results, and facilitates compatibility with external data sources. Using strings ensures accuracy and consistency when working with decimal values using the Decimal class.\n",

    "Combining Decimal objects with integers in arithmetic operations is simple. Python handles the conversion and promotion automatically, allowing for precise arithmetic with exact decimal representation.

    "**Ans:** Arithmetic operfations like Adding,subtracting or multiplying a Decimal object by a floating-point value is generates an error. To do these operations, the floating point has to be converted to a Decimal.    \n",
    "Combining Decimal objects and floating-point values requires explicit conversion and attention to precision. While it is possible to combine them, care must be taken to handle potential imprecision and floating-point approximation errors. To maintain accurate results, it is generally recommended to perform arithmetic operations involving Decimal objects whenever precise decimal representation is required."

    "**Ans:** Value of `0.5` will be represented as `Â½`.\n",
    "Using the Fraction class in Python, a quantity that can be expressed with absolute precision is a rational number. Rational numbers are numbers that can be represented as a fraction of two integers, where the numerator and denominator are both integers.   \n",
