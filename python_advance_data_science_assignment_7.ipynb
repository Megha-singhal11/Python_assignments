    "**Ans:** The Popular try statement variations are:\n",
    "1. **`try`,`except`**\n",
    "2. **`try`,`except`,`finally`**\n",
    "3. **`try`,`except`,`finally`,`else`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`try`** block is used to check code for exceptions during runtime. ie code inside `try` block will execute completely when there is no error in the program. Whereas the code inside `except` block will execute whenever the program encounters some error in the preceeding **`try`** block.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using `except` Blocks:** This variation involves using one or more `except` blocks to catch and handle specific exceptions that might occur within the `try` block. You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions. The control will go to the first matching `except` block based on the type of exception raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "   except SomeException:\n",
    "       # Code to handle the specific exception\n",
    "   except AnotherException:\n",
    "       # Code to handle a different exception\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       # Code that runs if no exception is raised in the try block\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas the code enters the **`else`** block if and only if the try clause does not raise and exception. The code in the **`finally`** block will execute irrespective of exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `finally` Blocks:** The `finally` block is used to contain code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This is useful for cleanup operations that need to happen regardless of the outcome of the `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   try:\n",
    "       # Code that might raise an exception\n",
    "   except SomeException:\n",
    "       # Code to handle the specific exception\n",
    "   finally:\n",
    "       # Code that always runs, regardless of whether an exception occurred\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these variations play a crucial role in managing exceptions and ensuring proper program behavior. The `except` variation allows you to handle exceptions selectively, while the `finally` variation ensures that critical cleanup tasks are performed no matter the outcome of the `try` block."
