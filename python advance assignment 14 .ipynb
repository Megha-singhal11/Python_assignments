    "   A wrapper, in the context of software development, generally refers to a piece of code that provides an interface or encapsulates functionality from another piece of code.

Wrappers are commonly used to provide a more convenient or abstracted way to use existing functionality or to extend the behavior of existing components.\n",

    "   A decorator is a specific design pattern that allows you to dynamically add behavior to an object (or function) without altering its structure. In programming languages like Python, a decorator is often associated with modifying or enhancing functions or methods. Decorators are functions that take another function (or method) as an argument and return a new function with added behavior. They are commonly used for tasks like logging, caching, authentication, and more."
