    "\n",
    "1. **Readability:**\n",
    "   Naming groups makes the regular expression more self-explanatory. Instead of relying on numeric indices, named groups provide meaningful labels that convey the purpose of each captured part of the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Documentation:**\n",
    "   Named groups act as a form of inline documentation for your regular expression. By using descriptive names, you provide clear context for what each captured group represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maintenance:**\n",
    "   When modifying the regular expression, using named groups makes it less error-prone. If the order or number of capturing groups changes, you don't need to update the code that references the groups by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexibility:**\n",
    "   Named groups allow you to rearrange the order of capturing groups without affecting code that relies on those groups by name. This provides more flexibility when refining or evolving your regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Self-Documenting Code:**\n",
    "   Named groups make the code more self-documenting by showing the intent of the captured content. This can improve collaboration and make the code easier to understand for other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Dynamic Group Referencing:**\n",
    "   Named groups allow you to refer to groups dynamically based on their names. This can be particularly useful when processing multiple regular expressions or when generating patterns programmatically.\n",

    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
