    "A probability distribution is a mathematical function or model that describes the likelihood of various outcomes or events in a random experiment or process. It provides a way to understand the probabilities associated with different possible values or events, allowing you to make predictions about the likelihood of certain outcomes occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the individual values in a probability distribution may be random, the distribution itself captures the overall pattern of randomness. Probability distributions provide insights into the range of possible outcomes, the likelihood of each outcome, and how those outcomes are distributed across the sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability distributions are used to model a wide range of real-world phenomena, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coin Tossing:** The probability distribution for a fair coin toss assigns equal probabilities to heads and tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dice Rolling:** The probability distribution for a fair six-sided die assigns equal probabilities to each of the six faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution):** This is a continuous probability distribution that describes many natural processes, such as heights, weights, and IQ scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Exponential Distribution:** Often used to model time between events, like the time between phone calls at a call center.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Poisson Distribution:** Used for modeling the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Binomial Distribution:** Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",

    "1. **True Random Numbers:**\n",
    "   True random numbers are generated from genuinely unpredictable sources in the physical world. These sources can include processes like radioactive decay, thermal noise, atmospheric noise, or electronic components' behavior. Since these sources are inherently unpredictable, the numbers they generate are considered truly random. True random number generators (TRNGs) capture this randomness and provide random numbers that are not influenced by any deterministic algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pseudo-Random Numbers:**\n",
    "   Pseudo-random numbers are generated by deterministic algorithms that use an initial value called a seed. While the generated numbers appear to be random, they are actually determined by the algorithm and the seed. Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) use mathematical formulas to produce sequences of numbers that exhibit statistical properties similar to those of true random numbers. However, they are not truly random because their outputs can be reproduced if the same seed is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while pseudo-random numbers are not truly random in the sense of being unpredictable at a fundamental level, they are considered \"good enough\" for many applications due to their statistical properties and efficiency. For applications requiring true unpredictability, such as cryptography, true random numbers are essential."

    "   The mean, often denoted as μ (mu), represents the central value or average of the distribution. It indicates where the peak of the bell curve is located. The mean determines the symmetry of the distribution. If the mean is shifted to the left, the distribution will be skewed to the left; if it's shifted to the right, the distribution will be skewed to the right.\n",

    "   The standard deviation, often denoted as σ (sigma), measures the spread or dispersion of the distribution.

The standard deviation provides information about how much individual data points deviate from the mean.\n",
