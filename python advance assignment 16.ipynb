    "### Q1. What is the benefit of regular expressions?\n",
    "**Ans:** Regular Expressions, also known as **`regex`** or **`regexp`**, are used to match strings of text such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. It means that we can match and extract any string pattern from the text with the help of regular expressions. it helps the programmers to Write less and cleaner code. it also avoids multiple use of **`if/else`** statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EXAMPLE:\n",
    "**re.search(pattern, string): Searches for a pattern anywhere in the string and returns the first match found.   \n",
    "re.match(pattern, string): Matches the pattern only at the beginning of the string.   \n",
    "re.findall(pattern, string): Returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string as a list.   \n",
    "re.sub(pattern, replacement, string): Replaces all occurrences of the pattern in the string with the replacement.   \n",
    "re.compile(pattern): Compiles the pattern into a regex object for improved performance when using it repeatedly.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions provide a concise and powerful way to work with text patterns in Python, enabling efficient searching, matching, and manipulation of text data."

    "### Q2. Describe the difference between the effects of \"(ab)c+\" and \"a(bc)+\" Which of these, if any, is the unqualified pattern \"abc+\"?\n",
    "**Ans:** Both **`(ab)c+`** and **`a(bc)+`** are valid patterns. the difference between both these patterns is in **`(ab)c+`** **`ab`** is group whereas in **`a(bc)+`** **`bc`** is a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"(ab)c+\":**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This pattern matches strings that start with \"ab\" and are followed by one or more occurrences of the letter \"c\". The parentheses indicate a capturing group, which captures the substring \"ab\" as a group.\n",
    "2. Examples of strings that match this pattern: \"abc\", \"abcc\", \"abccc\", and so on.\n",
    "3. The \"+\", outside the parentheses, specifies that the capturing group should occur one or more times consecutively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"a(bc)+\":**\n",

    "**Ans:** The Characters **`.`,`*`,`?`,`^`**,or,**`()`**, have a special signiface when used with square brackets. They need not be be explicitly escaped by **`\\`** as in case of pattern texts in a raw string.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Ans:** We can Combine a regular expression pattern into pattern Objects.Which can be used for pattern matching. it also helps to search a pattern again without rewritting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The compilation process optimizes the regex pattern and creates a compiled representation that can be executed faster than repeatedly using the pattern without compilation.\n",
    "2. This improves code readability and allows you to reuse the compiled regex object multiple times throughout your codebase, reducing duplication and enhancing maintainability.\n",
    "3. function accepts optional flags and options as arguments. These flags enable you to modify the behavior of the regex pattern, such as case insensitivity or multiline matching.\n",

    "**Ans:** The **`re.search()`** and **`re.match()`** both are functions of re module in python. These functions are very efficient and fast for searching in strings. The function searches for some substring in a string and returns a match object if found, else it returns none.\n",
    "\n",
