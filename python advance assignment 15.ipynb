    "Python 3.8 introduced several new features and improvements. Here are some of the notable additions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assignment Expressions (the \"walrus operator\"):**\n",
    "   This feature allows you to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression. It's denoted by the `:=` syntax. It's particularly useful in list comprehensions and while working with conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Positional-Only Parameters:**\n",
    "   Python 3.8 introduced the ability to define positional-only parameters in function signatures using the `/` syntax. This allows you to specify that certain parameters can only be passed using positional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **f-strings Improvements:**\n",
    "   Python 3.8 extended f-strings with the \"=`\" option, which allows you to include the variable's repr() in the string, aiding in debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **New Syntax Warning:**\n",
    "   Python 3.8 introduced a new `SyntaxWarning` for cases where you use a backslash to continue a statement across multiple lines. This is to discourage the use of backslashes for line continuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Math Functions Improvements:**\n",
    "   The `math` module was extended with new functions like `math.isqrt()` for computing the integer square root and `math.prod()` for computing the product of iterable elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **New Syntax Features:**\n",
    "   Python 3.8 introduced the `=` syntax to indicate that a function parameter is intended to be a keyword-only argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **TypedDict:**\n",
    "   The `typing` module introduced `TypedDict`, a type that represents a dictionary with a fixed set of keys and specific value types.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **__future__ Annotations:**\n",
    "   The `__future__` module was updated to provide better compatibility for forward annotations (PEP 563), which allow you to use string literals as type annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Other Improvements:**\n",
    "   Python 3.8 also brought performance improvements, security enhancements, and various optimizations. It included updates to the standard library, the addition of new modules, and enhancements to existing ones."
